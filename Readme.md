# Extensible Image Processing Framwork

## Resources Used

- [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/index.html): Great imaging library that can provide the launch platform of analyzing the images using machine learning if desired.

## How to Use

Run program passing in a folder path to search: *defaults to folder where deployed* and then an optional BatchSize argument to get the usage run ImageProcessor /?

## Reason Created

I am a member of a VB.Net group and a member wanted help with his image processing of Astronomy pictures.  He is taking pictures of some cool things.  I developed this as a platform for him to process various images.  He had some beginnings of things but I felt he needed a stronger OOP designed way of handling it.

# FITS Histogram Data Generator

So some of the slowdown is linqpad stuff and the fact I am using util.ondemand and such.  Read the code for underatanding on how it works.  I did not include error handling for the tasks.  You should make sure the tasks have exception handling.

Notice the time savings.  See how I total all work times together and then show how long it took to process.  Play with the batchsize variable.
